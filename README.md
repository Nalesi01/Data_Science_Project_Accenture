# Data_Science_Project_Accenture
This is a project focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture. For this work, I
cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions. Thereafter,
prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.
